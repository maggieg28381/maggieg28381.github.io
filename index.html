      <p>maggie is here
      to swag or not to swag that is the question.... there are times in life when one must
      choose to sacrifice the level of swag in one's possession... of course the time is during
    prelim season, I die every time. My swag is unbounded and it reigns supreme on
    <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/plotsummary>
    fury road </a> where
  mad max drives his giant war rig. I like explosions in movies, high swag level. </p>

  <p> Sometimes I just don't know <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com"> anything</a>, to be honest. </p>
<p> swag my nuggets me gusta pollo loco </p>
<p> I want to go to the <a href=https://www.sha.cornell.edu/> hotel school </a>. I think that the hotel
school is a better fit for me
  because it's like a business major but more focused on hospitality. I love helping people.
  I don't like arts and scences I NEED TO ESCAPE LMAO </p>
